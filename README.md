- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZiggidyZ
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning. I know a LITTLE BIT about many things, barely enough to be dangerous.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning essentially everything.

- I began learning coding by playing with HTML in the mid 1990's. I would copy basic static websites over to geocities and/or saved html files on my computer. I would then poke and prod to learn how different parts of the code would shape and color the website.
- I had brief experience with true BASIC as well as C++ in the late 1990s.
- I have been administering a few Linux servers in a home lab for the past decade. I am really not great, but my Google-fu gets me through most of what I need.
- Presently I enjoy working on projects involving Raspberry Pi and Arduino hardware. Again, I have VERY LITTLE knowledge, completely unable to do much other than navigate, create & destroy files, and a few other limited things without having to start searching, but I enjoy learning it.
